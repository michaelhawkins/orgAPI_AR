== Welcome to Organization API on Postgres

I was working on a new project that needed RESTful services sitting on Postgres and Mongo. I hate learning new tech in the project so I tend to make publicly accessible projects to learn the tech. I believe (fingers crossed) that learning outside of the project will let it proceed without polluting it with bad tech. It will only be polluted by slightly bad tech. ;-)
